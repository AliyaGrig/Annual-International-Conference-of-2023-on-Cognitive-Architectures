# Annual-International-Conference-of-2023-on-Cognitive-Architectures

On the Annual International Conference of 2023 on Cognitive Architectures, this day felt like a scene from an epic movie. Picture this: a dazzling hall, stars in the field of artificialintelligence from all corners of the globe. And here I am, at the center of this global theater, presenting my work: "Emotionally Integrated Cognitive Architectures."

I've been engaged in  research and development in the field of cognitive architectures for a long time, and not without reason. It is currently a key direction for creating new generations of artificial intelligences that will be more efficient, sensitive, and useful in general.

In this day, we delved deeper into the mysteries of the Хэштег#humanbrain, searching for answers to questions like: How can we give artificial intelligence a heart? How can we teach a robot to empathize? And I believe we found something akin to answers.

This day felt like a grand cinematic award ceremony. Meetings with the stars of cognitive science, thunderous applause, and the exchange of ideas. Our conversations with colleagues warmed the heart, like the pivotal moments of a film that linger in memory.

I thank BICAAI 2023 for this festival of the mind! Ahead of us lies a cosmic era of discoveries.
